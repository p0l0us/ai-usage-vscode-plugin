## 0.0.4 (2026-09-11)

- Chat chips are text only, `Claude 4% (5h)` `26% (7d)` by default, `Claude n/a` when the agent is not signed in
  where the extension runs. New settings `aiUsage.chatChips.labels` (`none` / `name`) and `aiUsage.chatChips.usage`
  (`simple`, one figure for the most used window / `rich`, every window). The icon chip is gone: VS Code drops the
  text of a toolbar item that has an icon. Clicking a chip opens a dialog with the same text as the status bar tooltip (plan, account or organization, per-window usage,
  reset times, last update). `aiUsage.chatChips.icon` was removed.
- Status bar: `aiUsage.statusBar.labels` gained `none` and `nameOnly`; new `aiUsage.statusBar.usage` (`simple` /
  `rich`) chooses between the most used window and every window.
- Status bar items no longer open a quick pick on click; the figures are in the hover. The Copilot item still
  opens the GitHub access request when access is missing. **AI Usage: Show Details** shows the same dialog for
  every enabled service.
- Removed the quick-pick details panel.

## 0.0.1 (unreleased)

- Status bar items with live usage for Claude Code, Codex and GitHub Copilot.
- Chat input chips for the agent the current chat is locked to (VS Code 1.137+).
- Structured details panel with per-service windows, account/organization and reset times.
- Copilot account selection following the workspace repository's organization; org billing figures for admins.
- Selectable sources per service (`api`, `cli`, `sessionLog` for Codex) and per-service check intervals.
- `aiUsage.statusBar.enabled` / `aiUsage.statusBar.labels` (icon only by default) for the status bar.
- `aiUsage.chatChips.icon` vendor-icon chip and `aiUsage.chatChips.workbench` to show chips in regular windows only when no status bar shows the figures.
- Shared on-disk cache across windows with `Retry-After` aware backoff; stale readings greyed out after 15 minutes.
- `n/a` chip for the chat's own agent when it is not signed in where the extension runs (typically a Claude or Codex chat in the Agents window, whose local extension cannot see a remote login); the details say where to sign in.
- README screenshots are bundled in the VSIX; `dev:install` keeps the image links relative so a local install renders them.
